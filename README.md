# PlayFX
PlayFX is a light framework for managing multiple scenes in JavaFX. More specifically, it provides an easy way to manage the different states of a JavaFX application and to pass from one to another. Moreover, it comes with an embedded [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) system.

## A Work in Progress
As of now, the work is still in progress and the framework is not quite stable.

## Documentation

Usage, documentation and samples can be found on [PlayFX's wiki](https://github.com/KazeJiyu/PlayFX/wiki).
